# Background Jobs

Ideally some time consuming job should be performed behind the scenes out of the main HTTP request context. For example, sending email to a user blocks the application untill the processing finishes and this may provide a bad experience to your application users. 

What if you could perform time consuming tasks, such as sending emails, in the background without blocking the actual request?
