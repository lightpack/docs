<img src="_media/logo.png" style="width: 20%">

<p class="tip">A modern PHP web framework with extreme performance and small footprint.</p>

The philosophy that drives `Lightpack` PHP framework:

* Avoid facades for unnecessary syntactic sugar.
* Avoid interfaces just for the sake of interfaces.
* Cut down the layers to minimize deep call chains.
* Avoid wrappers around wrappers around wrappers. "The wrappers hell."
* Avoid jargons in favor of well known terms. (Example: Model instead of Gateway)
* All design choices come with tradeoffs.
* It's okay to violate few industry best practices.
* Avoid crippled today for an easier future tomorrow.
