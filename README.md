The philosophy that drives `Lightpack` PHP framework:

* Avoid facades for unnecessary syntactic sugar.
* Avoid interfaces just for the sake of interfaces.
* Avoid wrappers around wrappers around wrappers. "The wrappers hell."
* Avoid jargons in favor of well known terms. (Example: Model instead of Gateway)
* Avoid thick abstractions to promote less bloated core. 
* Avoid promoting thousand ways for doing the same thing.
* Cut down the layers to minimize deep call chains.
* All design choices come with tradeoffs.
* It's okay to violate few industry best practices.
