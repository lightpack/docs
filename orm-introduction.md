# Lucid ORM

<code>Lucid ORM</code> is Lightpack's highly performant and sleek object relational mapper
to help you with some of the most common tasks when dealing with relational databases.

When it comes to data access patterns, there is a lot of debate about ORMs in any programming 
community. Some even consider it an <code>anti-pattern</code>. Some hate it because it may introduce 
possible <code>leaky-abstraction</code> and <code>cost performance</code>. Some even think that an 
ORM makes <b>simple things easy and difficult things dead difficult</b>.

In that sense, Lightpack has no opinion about whether you should use or reject the
concept of ORM at all. That being said, Lighpack does come with a dead simple abstraction 
which you might like though for its simplicity and performance.

<p class="tip">Lucid ORM is an easy to use and highly performant <code>Active Record</code> pattern implementation that also supports <code>relationships</code> for the most common use-case scenarios.</p>
