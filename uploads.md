- SEO-friendly URLs for public assets
- Clean, intuitive API

## Installation

The Uploads module is included with Lightpack framework. To set up the database table, run the migration:

```php
php console migrate create_table_uploads
```

## Basic Usage

### Preparing Your Model

Add the `UploadTrait` trait to any model that needs file upload capabilities:

```php
use Lightpack\Uploads\UploadTrait;

class User extends Model
{
    use UploadTrait;
    
    // ...
}
```

### Attaching Files

#### Single File Upload

This is particularly:

* Profile Pictures: When a user uploads a new avatar, you want to delete the old one
* Featured Images: When a product or article has a single featured image
* Document Replacements: When a document should be replaced rather than having multiple versions

```php
// Attach a file from a form upload (public)
$user->attach('avatar', [
    'collection' => 'profile',
    'singleton' => true, // Only keep one file in this collection
]);
```

```php
// Attach a file as private (requires access control)
$user->attach('document', [
    'collection' => 'confidential',
    'singleton' => true,
    'private' => true,
]);
```

#### Multiple File Upload

```php
// Attach multiple files from a form upload (public)
$photos = $user->attachMultiple('photos', [
    'collection' => 'gallery',
]);
```

```php
// Attach multiple files as private
$documents = $user->attachMultiple('documents', [
    'collection' => 'private-documents',
    'private' => true,
]);
```

#### Remote File Upload

```php
// Attach a file from a URL (public)
$user->attachFromUrl('https://example.com/image.jpg', [
    'collection' => 'remote',
]);
```

```php
// Attach a file from a URL as private
$user->attachFromUrl('https://example.com/confidential.pdf', [
    'collection' => 'private-remote',
    'private' => true,
]);
```

### Retrieving Uploads

```php
// Get all uploads in 'profile' collection
$uploads = $user->uploads('profile')->get();
```

```php
// Get the first upload in 'profile' collection
$avatar = $user->firstUpload('profile');
```

### Working with Upload Models

Once you have fetched the uploaded model, you can work with it as documented below:

```php
// Get the URL to the file 
// Note: returns empty string for private files
$url = $avatar->url();
```

```php
// Get the URL to a transformed version
$thumbnailUrl = $avatar->url('thumbnail');
```

```php
// Get the file path
$path = $avatar->getPath();
```

```php
// Check if a file exists
if ($avatar->exists('thumbnail')) {
    // ...
}
```

```php
// Check if a file is private
if ($avatar->is_private) {
    // Handle private file access
}
```

```php
// Get file metadata
$mimeType = $avatar->getMimeType();
$size = $avatar->getSize();
$meta = $avatar->getMeta();
```

### Deleting Uploads

```php
// Detach a specific upload
$user->detach($uploadId);
```

## Image Transformations

With the image based uploads, you can define image transformations when attaching files:

```php
$user->attach('avatar', [
    'collection' => 'profile',
    'transformations' => [
        'thumbnail_small' => ['resize', 200, 200],
        'thumbnail_medium' => ['resize', 400, 400],
    ],
]);
```

The value of the transformation key is the image transformation related methods and required arguments:

```
[resize, 200, 200]
```

Then access the transformed versions:

```php
$thumbnailUrl = $avatar->url('thumbnail');
$mediumUrl = $avatar->url('medium');
```

### Asynchronous Image Transformations

If background jobs processing has been configured to run, then all image transformation happen asynchronously.

You can also customize image transformations job queue name, max transformation attaempts, and retries related configurations in the `.env` file.

```env
UPLOADS_QUEUE=uploads
UPLOADS_MAX_ATTEMPT=3
UPLOADS_RETRY_AFTER=10 seconds
```


### How Transformations Work

Transformations are processed automatically when you attach a file with transformations defined:

1. The original image is loaded
2. Each transformation is applied
3. Transformed versions are saved to the appropriate storage location

You can specify different dimensions for each variant:

```php
'transformations' => [
    'transformations' => [
        'thumbnail_small' => ['resize', 200, 200],
        'thumbnail_medium' => ['resize', 400, 400],
        'banner' => ['resize', 1200, 300],
    ],
]
```

## File Storage System

The Uploads module uses Lightpack's **Storage** system to store files in a consistent way:

```php
// Public files (accessible via URL)
$user->attach('avatar', [
    'collection' => 'profile',
]);

// Files are stored in: uploads/public/media/{id}/filename.jpg
// And accessible via: /uploads/media/{id}/filename.jpg
```

### Public vs Private Uploads

Lightpack supports both public and private file uploads:

### Public Uploads

Public uploads are stored in `uploads/public/` and are directly accessible via URL. Use these for:

- Images displayed on your website
- Public documents
- Any files that don't require access control

```php
// Public uploads (default)
$model->attach('image');
$model->attachMultiple('photos');
$model->attachFromUrl('https://example.com/image.jpg');
```

### Private Uploads

Private uploads are stored in `uploads/private/` and require access control. They are not directly accessible via URL. Use these for:

- Confidential documents
- User-specific files that require authentication
- Any files that should not be publicly accessible

```php
// Private uploads (using the 'private' flag)
$model->attach('document', ['private' => true]);
$model->attachMultiple('files', ['private' => true]);
$model->attachFromUrl('https://example.com/confidential.pdf', ['private' => true]);
```

### Serving Private Files

To serve private files, you need to create a controller that implements access control:

```php
class FileController
{
    public function serve(int $id)
    {
        // Get the upload
        $upload = new UploadModel($id);
        
        if (!$upload || !$upload->exists()) {
            return response()->setStatus(404)->send('File not found');
        }
        
        // Optionally: check if the user has access permission
        if ($upload->is_private && !$this->userCanAccessFile($upload)) {
            return response()->setStatus(403)->send('Unauthorized');
        }
        
        // Get the stored file contents
        $contents = storage()->read($upload->getPath());
        
        // Create a response with the file contents
        $response = response();
        $response->setHeader('Content-Type', $upload->mime_type);
        $response->setHeader('Content-Disposition', 'inline; filename="' . $upload->file_name . '"');
        
        return $response->send($contents);
    }
    
    protected function userCanAccessFile(UploadModel $upload): bool
    {
        // Implement your access control logic here
        return true; // Replace with actual logic
    }
}
```

Then set up a route to this controller:

```php
$router->get('/files/{id}', 'FileController@serve');
```

### URL Structure

The URL structure depends on the storage location:

**For public uploads**

```php
// Stored at: uploads/public/media/123/avatar.jpg
// URL: /uploads/media/123/avatar.jpg
```

**For transformed versions**

```php
// Stored at: uploads/public/media/123/thumbnail/avatar.jpg
// URL: /uploads/media/123/thumbnail/avatar.jpg
```

### Customizing Upload Paths

By default, files are stored in `uploads/public/media/{model_id}/{filename}`, but you can customize this:

```php
$user->attach('avatar', [
    'collection' => 'profile',
    'path' => 'users/' . $user->id . '/avatars',
]);
```

**This results in:**

```php
// Storage path: uploads/public/users/123/avatars/image.jpg
// URL: /uploads/users/123/avatars/image.jpg
```

This allows you to organize files in a way that makes sense for your application.

## Cloud Storage Integration

Lightpack's upload system works seamlessly with cloud storage providers like **Amazon S3** and **CloudFront**.

### Amazon S3 Storage

When storage is configured to use **S3**, Lightpack will:
- Store public files in the `uploads/public/` prefix
- Store private files in the `uploads/private/` prefix
- Generate appropriate URLs for each type

### CloudFront Integration

For optimal performance and SEO, Lightpack supports **CloudFront** integration:

- Public files (`uploads/public/*`) are served via permanent **CloudFront** URLs
- Private files (`uploads/private/*`) can be served via signed **CloudFront** URLs

#### CloudFront Best Practices

1. **For SEO-friendly URLs**:
   - Configure CloudFront to serve your `uploads/public/*` files
   - Set appropriate cache behaviors for different file types
   - Use permanent URLs for public content

2. **For Private Content**:
   - Configure CloudFront with Origin Access Identity (OAI) to restrict direct S3 access
   - Use CloudFront signed URLs with appropriate expiration times
   - Set up path patterns to restrict access to `uploads/private/*`

3. **For Video Content**:
   - Use CloudFront for global distribution
   - Configure appropriate cache behaviors for video files
   - Consider using signed URLs with short expiration for premium content

### Serving Private Files with CloudFront

For private files, you can create a controller that generates signed URLs:

```php
class PrivateFileController
{
    public function serve(int $id)
    {
        // Get the upload
        $upload = new UploadModel($id);
        
        if (!$upload || !$upload->exists() || !$upload->is_private) {
            return response()->setStatus(404)->send('File not found');
        }
        
        // Check if the current user has permission to access this file
        if (!$this->userCanAccessFile($upload)) {
            return response()->setStatus(403)->send('Unauthorized');
        }
        
        // Generate a signed URL (works with both S3 and CloudFront)
        $signedUrl = storage()->url($upload->getPath(), 3600); // 1 hour expiration
        
        // Redirect to the signed URL
        return response()->redirect($signedUrl);
    }
    
    protected function userCanAccessFile(UploadModel $upload): bool
    {
        // Implement your access control logic here
        return true; // Replace with actual logic
    }
}
```

### Listing Files in a Directory

The Storage system provides a `files()` method to list all files in a directory:

```php
$files = storage()->files('uploads/public/media/123');

foreach ($files as $file) {
    // Process each file
}
```

This works consistently across different storage backends (local filesystem, S3, etc.).

## Metadata and Validation

### File Metadata

All the uploads store comprehensive metadata about each file:

```php
$upload = $user->firstUpload('documents');
```

```php
// Basic metadata
$filename = $upload->file_name;
$extension = $upload->getExtension();
$mimeType = $upload->getMimeType();
$size = $upload->getSize();
```

You can also store custom meta data for the uploaded model:

```php
// Custom metadata
$upload->meta = [
    'title' => 'My Document',
    'description' => 'Important file',
    'tags' => ['important', 'document'],
];
$upload->save();
```

```php
// Later, retrieve custom metadata
$title = $upload->getMeta('title');
$tags = $upload->getMeta('tags', []);
```

### Validation

While the Uploads module doesn't include built-in validation, you can easily add it:

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Always use private uploads for sensitive content**
   ```php
   $user->attach('tax_document', ['private' => true]);
   ```

2. **Implement proper access control in your controllers**
   ```php
   if (!$this->userCanAccessFile($upload)) {
       return response()->setStatus(403);
   }
   ```

3. **Use short expiration times for signed URLs**
   ```php
   // 15 minutes is often sufficient for most use cases
   $signedUrl = $storage->url($upload->getPath(), 900);
   ```

### Performance

1. **Use CloudFront for global content delivery**
   - Configure your storage to use CloudFront for improved load times

2. **Implement appropriate caching headers**
   
```php
$response->setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=31536000');
```

3. **Use appropriate image transformations**
   
```php
// Should not serve original images directly to users
$user->attach('product_image', [
    'transformations' => [
        'thumbnail' => ['resize' => [200, 200]],
        'medium' => ['resize' => [600, 600]],
        'large' => ['resize' => [1200, 1200]],
    ],
]);
```

### SEO

1. **Use public uploads for content that should be indexed**
   ```php
   $product->attach('featured_image');
   ```

2. **Configure CloudFront for permanent, SEO-friendly URLs**
   - This avoids temporary URLs that search engines won't index

3. **Use descriptive filenames**
   ```php
   $product->attachFromUrl($imageUrl, [
       'filename' => 'blue-denim-jeans-product-front-view.jpg',
   ]);
   ```

## Error Handling

The upload methods can throw exceptions in case of errors:

```php
try {
    $upload = $user->attach('avatar', [
        'collection' => 'profile',
    ]);
} catch (FileUploadException $e) {
    // Handle upload errors
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // Handle other errors
}
```
