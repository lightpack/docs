# Rate Limiting

Rate limiting (throttling) helps control access rates to any resource - from HTTP routes to API calls to background jobs. Lightpack provides a simple, efficient utility for **rate limiting** actionsâ€”such as login attempts, API requests, or any operation you want to restrict to a certain number of times within a time window.. Use cases include:

- API request throttling
- Login attempt limits
- Job processing controls
- Resource usage limits
- Database write throttling

The **rate limiter** uses Lightpack's Cache system, supporting multiple drivers:
- Database (default)
- Redis
- File
- Array (for testing)
- Null (for disabled limiting)

> The configured cache driver becomes the backend for rate limiter. You do not need to seperately configure the rate limiter.

## Usage

You may create an instance of `Limiter` class:

```php
$limiter = new Lightpack\Utils\Limiter;
```

Or simply call the utility function `limiter()` which returns **Limiter** class instance.

Call the `attempt()` method of **Limiter** class instance to rate limit a block of code or an operation to be executed.

`attempt(string $key, int $max, int $seconds)`

- The **first** argument is a unique key (e.g., user ID, IP address, or action).
- The **second** argument is the max allowed attempts.
- The **third** argument is the window (in seconds).

**Example:** Rate limit user login to max 5 attempts per 60 seconds

```php
$loginAllowed = limiter()->attempt('login:user:123', 5, 60);
```

```php
if($loginAllowed) {
    // Allowed: perform the action
} else {
    // Rate limit exceeded: block or notify
}
```

**Key Generation**

Keys can be anything unique to what you're limiting:

```php
// Examples
'ip:127.0.0.1'           // IP-based
'user:123'               // User-based
'api:endpoint:/users'     // API endpoint
'upload:user:123'        // Resource usage
'jobs:processor:1'       // Job processing
```

## Checking Attempts

You can check how many attempts have been made in the current window:

```php
$hits = $limiter->getHits('login:' . $userId); // returns int|null
```

## How It Works

- On the first attempt, the window is started and the hit count is set to 1.
- Each subsequent allowed attempt increments the count, but the window's TTL is preserved.
- If the max is reached, `attempt()` returns `false` until the window expires.
- Once expired, the count resets automatically.

## Examples

```php
// Allow 3 requests per 10 seconds from an IP
if ($limiter->attempt(request()->ip(), 3, 10)) {
    // process request
} else {
    // too many requests
}

```

## HTTP Rate Limiting

You can rate limit HTTP routes using the rate limit filter

```php
// Basic
route()
    ->get('/api', ApiController::class)
    ->filter(['limit:60,1']);

// Group limits
route()->group(['filter' => ['limit:1000,60']], function() {
    route()->get('/api/users', 'UserController::class');
    route()->get('/api/posts', 'PostController::class');
});

// With other filters
route()
    ->post('/upload', UploadController::class)
    ->filter(['auth', 'limit:10,60']);
```

**When rate limited, clients receive:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1616721340
Retry-After: 60

Too many requests. Please try again in 1 minute.
```
